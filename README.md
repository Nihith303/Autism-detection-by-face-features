A deep learning-based web application for early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through facial feature analysis. This tool uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze facial characteristics that may indicate ASD, providing a preliminary assessment that can support early intervention.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Facial Feature Analysis**: Examines key facial landmarks and expressions
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained CNN model for accurate predictions
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple web interface for easy interaction
- **Early Detection**: Aids in identifying potential ASD indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual Environment (recommended)
